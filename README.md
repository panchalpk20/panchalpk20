## About me

### Hi there! I'm Purushottam Panchal 👋

I'm a software engineer and M.S. Computer Science candidate at DePaul University (expected Jun 2026). I build reliable backend systems, automation pipelines, and web applications — with hands-on experience across Java-based systems, C#/.NET services, and front-end work using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. My repositories reflect a mix of academic and production work: Java-centric projects for systems and course assignments, full-stack web projects (C# + TypeScript) from web development courses, and distributed/automation projects that use scripting and cloud tools.

Professional highlights include backend API development, CI/CD and automation (Jenkins, Azure DevOps), and cloud integrations on AWS and Azure. I focus on writing maintainable code, improving test coverage, and shipping features reliably.
